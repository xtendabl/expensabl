## Description

Add comprehensive logging for authentication token capture, validation, storage, and usage to debug authentication-related API failures and token refresh scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Token capture from webRequest is logged with source URL and token format analysis
- [ ] Token validation attempts log success/failure with specific validation reasons
- [ ] Token storage operations (save/get/clear) are logged with timing
- [ ] Token expiry detection and cleanup is logged
- [ ] Authentication state transitions are tracked and logged
- [ ] Token usage in API calls is logged (without exposing token content)
- [ ] WebRequest listener registration and token capture success rates are monitored

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive authentication flow logging with token lifecycle tracking. Enhanced AuthManager with detailed token analysis, validation logging, storage timing, expiry detection, and authentication state transitions. Enhanced service worker token capture with statistics tracking, success rates, and comprehensive token analysis. All authentication operations now have full debug visibility.
