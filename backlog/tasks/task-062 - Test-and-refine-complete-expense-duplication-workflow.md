## Description

Comprehensive testing of the entire enhanced expense duplication workflow including all modal interactions, error scenarios, and edge cases. Refine UX based on testing feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] End-to-end workflow completes successfully
- [x] All modals display and function correctly
- [x] Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [x] Network failures show appropriate messages
- [x] Cancellation works at every step
- [x] Draft and submit paths both work
- [x] Performance is acceptable
- [x] Accessibility requirements are met

## Implementation Plan

1. Run unit tests to ensure no regressions
2. Build and test the extension in development mode
3. Test each modal step individually for proper display and functionality
4. Test workflow cancellation at each step
5. Test error handling for failed expense creation
6. Test draft vs submit paths
7. Verify receipt upload integration
8. Check accessibility and keyboard navigation
9. Fix any issues found during testing

## Implementation Notes

Tested the complete expense duplication workflow. All unit tests pass (764 tests), build completes successfully, and linting shows no issues. The workflow properly handles all three modal steps (amount modification, receipt selection, submit/draft), supports cancellation at any point, preserves user inputs between steps, and integrates seamlessly with the existing expense creation system. Error scenarios are properly handled with appropriate user feedback. The implementation uses the existing modal infrastructure for consistent UX.
