## Description

Users are not discovering the field customization feature in the Expense Detail view because the settings button is not prominent enough. The current gear icon with only a tooltip does not clearly communicate that clicking it allows users to reorganize and customize which fields are displayed. This results in users missing a valuable feature that could improve their workflow efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Settings button has a clear text label indicating its purpose
- [x] Button displays both icon and descriptive text like 'Customize Display' or 'Configure Fields'
- [x] Button has improved visual prominence through styling or positioning
- [x] Tooltip provides detailed description of the customization capabilities
- [x] Button maintains accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels
- [x] Visual design is consistent with the rest of the UI
- [x] All existing field customization functionality continues to work

## Implementation Plan

1. Locate the field customization button in the Expense Detail view
2. Add descriptive text label alongside the gear icon
3. Improve button styling for better visibility
4. Update tooltip with detailed description
5. Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels
6. Test the changes work correctly

## Implementation Notes

Successfully improved the visibility and clarity of the field customization button.

**Changes made:**
- Added descriptive text "Customize Display" alongside the gear icon
- Enhanced tooltip with detailed description: "Customize which fields are displayed and their order. Select up to 8 fields to show in expense details."
- Added proper ARIA label for accessibility
- Implemented prominent gradient button styling with hover effects

**Files modified:**
- `src/chrome/sidepanel-ui.ts` - Updated button HTML and CSS styling

**Technical decisions:**
- Used gradient background (purple to indigo) to make button stand out
- Added hover animation with subtle lift effect
- Maintained gear emoji icon for visual continuity
- Ensured button is clearly visible next to "Open in Navan" link

The button now clearly communicates its purpose and is much more discoverable by users.
