## Description

Build a foundational modal system that can be reused across the application for various user prompts and dialogs. This system should handle modal lifecycle, backdrop, animations, and keyboard interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Base modal component with consistent styling is implemented
- [x] Modal manager can control modal display and queue
- [x] Backdrop prevents interaction with background elements
- [x] ESC key closes modal
- [x] Modal animations for open/close are smooth
- [x] Multiple modal types can extend base modal
- [x] Z-index management prevents overlay issues

## Implementation Plan

1. Create base Modal class with lifecycle methods
2. Implement ModalManager singleton for managing modal queue
3. Add backdrop element with event handling
4. Implement keyboard event listeners for ESC key
5. Add CSS animations for smooth open/close transitions
6. Create extensible modal types (Confirm, Prompt, Custom)
7. Implement z-index management system

## Implementation Notes

Implemented a comprehensive modal system infrastructure with:
- Base Modal class with lifecycle methods (open, close, setContent, setTitle)
- ModalManager singleton for managing modal queue and z-index
- Backdrop element with configurable click-to-close behavior
- ESC key handling for closing modals
- Smooth CSS animations for open/close transitions
- Extensible modal types: ConfirmModal, PromptModal, LoadingModal
- Z-index management to prevent overlay issues
- Comprehensive test coverage (49 passing tests)
- Helper functions for easy modal creation
