## Description

The 'Customize Display' button in the expense detail view does not respond to clicks. The event listener appears to be attached but the showFieldSettings method is not being called. This prevents users from customizing which fields are displayed in expense details.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clicking 'Customize Display' button opens the field settings modal
- [ ] Field settings modal displays available and selected fields
- [ ] Users can select and reorder fields in the modal
- [ ] Modal can be closed via Cancel button or backdrop click
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass

## Implementation Notes

Fixed the non-functional 'Customize Display' button. The issue was a reference error where fieldSettings.render() was being called outside of the try-catch block where fieldSettings was defined. The solution involved:

1. Moved fieldSettings.render() inside the try-catch block where fieldSettings is instantiated
2. Added proper error handling to catch and report any initialization errors
3. Ensured the button event listener is properly attached when expense details are displayed
4. Verified the modal opens correctly and field settings component initializes properly
