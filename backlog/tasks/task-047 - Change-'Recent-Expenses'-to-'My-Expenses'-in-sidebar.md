## Description

The current sidebar header displays 'Recent Expenses' which doesn't accurately reflect that these are the user's own expenses, not just recent ones. The term 'My Expenses' better communicates ownership and aligns with user expectations for personal expense management. This change improves clarity and makes the interface more user-friendly. Relates to Jira EXPL-19.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The text 'Recent Expenses' is replaced with 'My Expenses' in sidepanel.html
- [x] The sidebar displays 'My Expenses' as the section header
- [x] All functionality related to the expenses section continues to work
- [x] The change is visible in the Chrome extension side panel

## Implementation Notes

Successfully changed the section header from 'Recent Expenses' to 'My Expenses'.

**File modified:**
- `public/sidepanel.html` - Line 1722: Changed h2 text from 'Recent Expenses' to 'My Expenses'

Simple text change that better reflects that these are the user's own expenses.
