## Description

The thumbnailUrl and fullUrl fields in receipt-related types and interfaces are set but never used in the UI. The system uses receipt keys directly for all operations, making these fields unnecessary.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] thumbnailUrl and fullUrl fields are removed from ReceiptUploadResult interface
- [ ] Related type definitions are updated
- [ ] Receipt upload response handling is adjusted
- [ ] Receipt viewing functionality continues to work with receipt keys

## Implementation Plan

1. Find all references to thumbnailUrl and fullUrl\n2. Remove from type definitions\n3. Update receipt upload response handling\n4. Verify tests still pass

## Implementation Notes

Removed thumbnailUrl and fullUrl fields from ReceiptAttachResponse interface in types.ts, ReceiptUploadResult interface in expense-operations.ts, and updated all related code. Updated test to reflect only receiptKey field. All 637 tests passing.
