## Description

Extend the messaging system types to support receipt attachment messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add ATTACH_RECEIPT to MessageAction enum
- [x] Define AttachReceiptMessage interface with proper payload structure
- [x] Support both ArrayBuffer and string (base64) data types
- [x] Include isBase64 flag for data type identification

## Implementation Plan

1. Locate existing message type definitions
2. Add ATTACH_RECEIPT action to enum
3. Create AttachReceiptMessage interface
4. Update message type union
5. Add response types for receipt operations

## Implementation Notes

- Added ATTACH_RECEIPT to MessageAction enum in `src/features/messaging/types.ts`
- Created AttachReceiptPayload interface supporting both ArrayBuffer and string (base64) data
- Created AttachReceiptMessage interface with proper action and payload structure
- Added AttachReceiptResponse interface for operation results
- Updated BackgroundMessage union type to include AttachReceiptMessage
- Added optional isBase64 flag to distinguish between data formats
- Created comprehensive test suite in `src/features/messaging/__tests__/receipt-types.test.ts`
- All 10 tests passing, verifying type safety and message validation
- Types are fully compatible with existing message handling infrastructure
