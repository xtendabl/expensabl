## Description

The sidepanel.js bundle currently exceeds webpack's recommended size limit (270 KiB vs 244 KiB limit), which impacts initial load performance and generates build warnings. This needs to be optimized through minification, code splitting, and lazy loading to improve extension performance and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size reduced below 244 KiB threshold
- [ ] No webpack performance warnings during production build
- [ ] Initial sidepanel load time improved
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact
- [ ] Build process supports both development and production configurations

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current webpack.config.js and bundle composition\n2. Check current bundle size and identify large dependencies\n3. Configure webpack optimizations (minification, code splitting)\n4. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components\n5. Test bundle size reduction and verify no functionality regression\n6. Ensure both development and production builds work correctly
