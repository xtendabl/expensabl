## Description

Add comprehensive logging for service worker initialization, restart events, background task execution, and Chrome API interactions to debug extension lifecycle issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Service worker initialization timing and success/failure is logged
- [ ] Service worker restart events are detected and logged with context
- [ ] Background task execution (template scheduling
- [ ] alarms) is logged with timing
- [ ] Chrome API call latency (storage
- [ ] alarms
- [ ] notifications) is measured and logged
- [ ] Memory usage and cleanup operations are tracked
- [ ] Extension lifecycle events (install
- [ ] startup
- [ ] suspend) are logged
- [ ] Service worker race conditions and initialization failures are captured

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive service worker lifecycle and background operation logging. Enhanced ServiceWorkerManager with initialization timing, restart detection, Chrome API call latency tracking, extension lifecycle events, memory usage monitoring, cleanup operations, and periodic statistics. Includes uptime tracking, component health monitoring, and performance metrics.
