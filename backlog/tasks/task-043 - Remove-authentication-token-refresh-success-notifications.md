## Description

Users are experiencing unnecessary popup notifications when authentication tokens are successfully refreshed. These notifications interrupt workflow and provide no actionable information since token refresh is an expected background operation. The notifications should be removed to improve user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Authentication token refresh continues to work silently without notifications
- [x] Error notifications for failed token operations are still displayed
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] No regressions in token capture and storage functionality

## Implementation Plan

1. Search for notification code related to token refresh in the codebase
2. Identify where success notifications are triggered for token operations
3. Remove or comment out success notification calls while preserving error notifications
4. Verify token refresh functionality still works correctly
5. Run all tests to ensure no regressions

## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed authentication token refresh success notifications while maintaining error notifications for better user experience.

**Approach taken:**
- Located two places where success notifications were triggered for token operations
- Removed chrome.notifications.create() calls for successful token captures

**Files modified:**
- `src/features/messaging/handlers/token/save-token.handler.ts` - Removed success notification when token is saved via content script
- `src/chrome/service-worker.ts` - Removed success notification when token is captured via webRequest API
- `src/chrome/__tests__/service-worker.test.ts` - Updated test to verify notifications are NOT shown on success

**Technical decisions:**
- Left informational logging intact for debugging purposes
- Preserved all error notification paths for template scheduling failures
- Maintained token capture and validation logic unchanged

The token refresh now operates silently in the background without interrupting user workflow, while still alerting users to genuine errors that require attention.
