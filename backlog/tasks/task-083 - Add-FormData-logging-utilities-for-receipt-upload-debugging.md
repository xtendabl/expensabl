## Description

Create utilities to log FormData contents for receipt uploads, enabling debugging of file upload edge cases and comparing successful vs failed upload scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FormData contents are logged with file metadata (name
- [ ] size
- [ ] type) without logging actual file data
- [ ] Non-file FormData entries are logged in full
- [ ] Custom logFormDataContents() method is implemented and used in receipt operations
- [ ] Receipt upload operations log FormData structure before API calls
- [ ] File type detection and validation steps are logged
- [ ] Upload timing and file processing steps are included in logs
- [ ] Logs enable comparison of different file types and sizes

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced FormData logging utilities throughout the receipt upload system. Added comprehensive logging in receipt operations handler including file metadata, type validation, base64 conversion timing, FormData structure analysis, and upload timing. Created logFormDataStructure() method for detailed FormData debugging. Enables comparison of different file types and sizes.
