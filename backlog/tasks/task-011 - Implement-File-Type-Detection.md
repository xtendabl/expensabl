## Description

Create robust file type detection for Navan API compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Map MIME types to Navan format (e.g. 'image/jpeg' â†’ 'jpg')
- [ ] Fallback to file extension parsing
- [ ] Handle edge cases (jpeg vs jpg)
- [ ] Return 'unknown' for unsupported types

## Implementation Plan

1. Create file type mapping utilities\n2. Map MIME types to Navan-compatible formats\n3. Add fallback to file extension parsing\n4. Handle common edge cases and variations\n5. Add comprehensive tests

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive file type detection utilities with MIME type mapping, file extension fallback, and Navan API compatibility. Added validation for supported receipt types, file size formatting, and comprehensive unit tests. Integrated the detector into the AttachReceiptHandler for proper file type detection and validation.
