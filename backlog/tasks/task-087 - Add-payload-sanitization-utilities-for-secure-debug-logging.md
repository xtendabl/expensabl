## Description

Create utilities to sanitize request/response payloads for logging by removing or redacting sensitive data while preserving structure for debugging.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sensitive fields (passwords
- [ ] tokens
- [ ] personal data) are redacted in logged payloads
- [ ] Payload structure and non-sensitive data is preserved for debugging
- [ ] Sanitization works for nested objects and arrays
- [ ] Custom sanitization rules can be configured per operation type
- [ ] File data and binary content is replaced with metadata (size
- [ ] type
- [ ] name)
- [ ] Sanitization utilities are reusable across different logging contexts
- [ ] Performance impact of sanitization is minimal and measured

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive payload sanitization utilities with PayloadSanitizer class. Supports redacting sensitive fields, handling special objects (File, FormData, binary data), nested objects, arrays, circular references, and max depth protection. Includes performance metrics and operation-specific sanitizers. All tests passing.
