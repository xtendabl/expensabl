## Description

The sidepanel currently displays a collapsible 'Help & Getting Started' section that should be removed from the user interface. This is a UI-only change - help content and documentation can remain available through other means if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Help & Getting Started accordion section is completely removed from sidepanel HTML
- [ ] Help-related UI event listeners in sidepanel-ui.ts are removed
- [ ] Help-related UI state and methods in sidepanel-ui.ts are cleaned up
- [ ] No console errors occur when loading the sidepanel
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Other sidepanel sections (Expenses) continue to function normally
- [ ] Help documentation remains accessible via other channels if needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine current sidepanel HTML structure to locate Help & Getting Started section\n2. Remove Help & Getting Started accordion section from sidepanel.html\n3. Clean up related JavaScript code in sidepanel-ui.ts (event listeners, state, methods)\n4. Remove any help-related constants or builders if they're only used for the removed section\n5. Test that sidepanel loads without errors and other sections work normally\n6. Run tests to ensure no regressions

## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed Help & Getting Started accordion section from sidepanel UI. Removed HTML section, CSS styles, JavaScript event listeners, and cleaned up unused files (help-content-builder.ts and help-content.ts). All tests pass and sidepanel loads without errors. Other sections (Expenses) continue to function normally.
