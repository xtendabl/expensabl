## Description

Remove all development debug console.log statements that were added during receipt upload implementation. These debug statements are no longer needed and clutter the production code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All console.log statements with debug prefixes ([RECEIPT_SERVICE], [HTTP_CLIENT], [REQUEST_BUILDER], [RECEIPT_HANDLER]) are removed
- [x] Production error logging through logger service remains intact
- [x] No functional changes to receipt operations
- [x] All tests continue to pass

## Implementation Plan

1. Search for all console.log statements with debug prefixes
2. Remove debug console.log statements
3. Keep logger service calls intact
4. Verify tests still pass

## Implementation Notes

Removed 18 debug console.log statements across 5 files:
- request-builder.ts: 4 statements
- expense-operations.ts: 5 statements
- http-client.ts: 2 statements
- receipt-operations.handler.ts: 5 statements
- expense-detail-with-receipt.ts: 2 statements
All logger service calls and production error logging preserved
