## Description

Add high-level logging for each expense operation (createExpense, fetchExpense, etc.) that logs the operation parameters and results to enable tracking of business logic flow and comparing different operation scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each expense operation logs request initiation with operation name and sanitized payload
- [ ] Each expense operation logs completion with response structure and sample data
- [ ] Operation timing is included in logs
- [ ] Request payloads are sanitized to remove sensitive data
- [ ] Response structures are analyzed using existing ResponseNormalizer methods
- [ ] Logs use consistent operation IDs for correlation
- [ ] Failed operations log error details along with request context

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive operation-level logging to ExpenseService. Each operation (fetchExpense, fetchExpenses, updateExpense, submitDraftExpense, uploadReceipt, getReceiptUrl, deleteReceipt) now logs initiation with sanitized payloads, completion with response structure analysis, timing metrics, and detailed error context. Uses consistent operation IDs for correlation.
