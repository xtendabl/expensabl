## Description

File type detection is called twice in receipt-operations.handler.ts for the same file. This redundant call should be consolidated to improve efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File type is detected only once per file upload
- [ ] The detected file type is reused for both validation and API calls
- [ ] File type validation logic remains intact
- [ ] Upload functionality continues to work correctly

## Implementation Plan

Already fixed in task-027

## Implementation Notes

Task completed as part of task-027. File type detection was simplified and redundant calls were removed when we inlined the file type detection logic.
