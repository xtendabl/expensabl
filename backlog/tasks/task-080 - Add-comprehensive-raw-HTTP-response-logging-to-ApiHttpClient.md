## Description

Add detailed logging of raw HTTP responses including status, headers, raw response text, and parsed data structure to enable comparison of successful vs failed API responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Raw response text is logged before JSON parsing with correlation ID
- [ ] Response status code and headers are logged
- [ ] Response size and content-type are included
- [ ] Parsed response structure is analyzed and logged using ResponseNormalizer
- [ ] Raw response is truncated appropriately for logging (10000 chars max)
- [ ] Response timing from request start is included
- [ ] Both successful and error responses are logged with same detail level

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive raw HTTP response logging to ApiHttpClient. Logs include response status, headers, content-type, raw response text (truncated to 10k chars), parsed response structure analysis, response timing, and detailed error response logging. Both successful and error responses logged with same detail level.
