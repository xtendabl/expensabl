## Description

Add detailed logging for each step of the createExpense 3-step process (draft creation, finalization, submission) to enable debugging of which specific step fails in edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Step 1 (draft creation) logs request payload and raw response with extracted expense ID
- [ ] Step 2 (finalization) logs update payload and response
- [ ] Step 3 (submission) logs submission request and final response
- [ ] Each step includes timing information and step-specific correlation data
- [ ] Draft vs non-draft expense paths are clearly distinguished in logs
- [ ] Step failures include context about which step failed and why
- [ ] Logs enable comparison between successful and failed multi-step operations

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive step-by-step logging for 3-step expense creation process. Each step (draft creation, finalization, submission/draft preservation) logs initiation with payloads, completion with response analysis, timing, and step-specific correlation IDs. Enhanced error handling identifies which step failed with detailed context. Draft vs non-draft paths clearly distinguished.
