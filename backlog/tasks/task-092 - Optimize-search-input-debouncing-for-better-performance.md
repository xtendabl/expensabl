## Description

The current search input debounce delay is only 300ms, which can cause excessive API calls and UI updates during rapid typing. Increasing the debounce delay and implementing proper cleanup will improve performance and reduce unnecessary network requests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search debounce delay is increased to 500ms or higher
- [ ] Debounce timeout is properly cleared on component unmount
- [ ] Search requests are reduced during rapid typing
- [ ] User experience remains responsive
- [ ] No duplicate search requests are sent
