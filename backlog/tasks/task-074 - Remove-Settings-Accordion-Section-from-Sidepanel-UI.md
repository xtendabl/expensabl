## Description

The sidepanel currently displays a collapsible 'Settings' section that should be removed from the user interface. This is a UI-only change - any backend settings functionality should remain intact for potential future use or API access.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Settings accordion section is completely removed from sidepanel HTML
- [ ] Settings-related UI event listeners in sidepanel-ui.ts are removed
- [ ] Settings-related UI state and methods in sidepanel-ui.ts are cleaned up
- [ ] No console errors occur when loading the sidepanel
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Other sidepanel sections (Expenses) continue to function normally
- [ ] User preferences stored in chrome.storage remain intact and accessible

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine current sidepanel HTML structure to identify settings accordion section\n2. Remove settings accordion HTML from sidepanel.html\n3. Remove settings-related event listeners from sidepanel-ui.ts\n4. Clean up settings-related UI state and methods in sidepanel-ui.ts\n5. Ensure chrome.storage user preferences remain intact\n6. Test sidepanel functionality to ensure no regressions\n7. Run tests to verify no breaking changes

## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed the Settings accordion section from the sidepanel UI while preserving all backend settings functionality and user preferences.

**Changes made:**
1. **HTML Removal**: Completely removed the settings-section div and all associated CSS styles from sidepanel.html, including:
   - Settings accordion header and toggle
   - 'Enable Expense Search' checkbox setting
   - 'Auto-fetch Expenses on Open' checkbox setting
   - All related CSS styling

2. **TypeScript Cleanup**: Removed settings UI-specific code from sidepanel-ui.ts:
   - Removed setupCollapsible call for settings section
   - Removed attachSettingsHandlers() method and all UI event listeners
   - Removed UI interaction code for settings checkboxes

3. **Preserved Backend Functionality**: All settings functionality remains intact:
   - expenseSearchEnabled setting still controls search section visibility
   - autoFetchExpenses setting still controls auto-fetch behavior on startup
   - Both settings are read from chrome.storage and applied automatically
   - User preferences stored in chrome.storage remain completely intact and accessible

**Verification:**
- Build compiles successfully with no errors
- All tests pass (49 test suites, 765 tests)
- No console errors when loading sidepanel
- Other sidepanel sections (Expenses, Help) continue to function normally
- Settings functionality works without UI (search visibility and auto-fetch behavior preserved)
- User preferences remain accessible via chrome.storage for future use or API access

The sidepanel now displays a cleaner interface focused on core functionality, with the settings accordion section completely removed from the user interface while maintaining all underlying settings behavior.
