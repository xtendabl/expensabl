## Description

The testBinaryEncoding function in binary-encoding.ts is a proof-of-concept testing function that is never used in production code and can be safely removed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] testBinaryEncoding function is removed from binary-encoding.ts
- [ ] No production code is affected
- [ ] Binary encoding utilities continue to function correctly
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Implementation Plan

Task no longer applicable - binary-encoding.ts was removed in task-025

## Implementation Notes

Task no longer applicable after task-025 completion. The entire binary-encoding.ts file was removed, including the testBinaryEncoding function.
