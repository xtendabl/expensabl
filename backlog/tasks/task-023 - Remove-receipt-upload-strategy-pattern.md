- [x] All tests pass

## Implementation Plan

1. Verify no upload strategy files exist
2. Confirm ReceiptService uses only primary endpoint
3. Run all tests to ensure no functionality is lost
4. Document completion

## Implementation Notes

Task completed:
- Verified no upload strategy files exist in the codebase
- Confirmed ReceiptService uses only the primary endpoint /expenses/{expenseId}/receipt
- Fixed all test files by adding receiptService mock dependency
- All 700 tests pass successfully
- No functionality was lost
