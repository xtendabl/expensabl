## Description

There is commented-out test code in receipt-types.test.ts that appears to be a placeholder or abandoned test case that should be removed for code cleanliness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Commented-out test code is removed from receipt-types.test.ts
- [ ] All active tests continue to pass
- [ ] Test coverage remains unchanged
- [ ] No test functionality is lost

## Implementation Plan

1. Find commented-out test code in receipt-types.test.ts\n2. Remove commented code\n3. Verify tests still pass

## Implementation Notes

Removed commented-out test code from receipt-types.test.ts (lines 160-167). The commented code was an example of invalid TypeScript that would cause compilation errors if uncommented. All 10 tests in the file continue to pass.
