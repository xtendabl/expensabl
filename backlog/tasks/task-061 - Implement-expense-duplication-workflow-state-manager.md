## Description

Create a state management system to track and control the multi-step expense duplication workflow. This manager should handle step progression, cancellation, and state cleanup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Workflow steps are tracked in sequence
- [x] Current step state is maintained
- [x] Cancel action works at any step
- [x] State is cleaned up on completion
- [x] User inputs are preserved between steps
- [x] Step validation prevents invalid progression
- [x] Workflow can be restarted after completion

## Implementation Plan

1. Create WorkflowStateManager class to track duplication workflow steps
2. Define workflow steps enum and state interface
3. Implement step progression and validation logic
4. Add state persistence and cleanup methods
5. Integrate with existing modal manager for coordination
6. Create workflow orchestrator to handle step transitions
7. Add cancellation and error recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Notes

Created ExpenseDuplicationWorkflow class that manages the entire multi-step expense duplication process. The workflow orchestrates three modal steps: amount modification, receipt selection, and submit/draft selection. Each step tracks state, validates progression, supports cancellation, and preserves user inputs. Integrated with the existing modal system and sidepanel UI. Created new receipt-selection-modal for file collection without immediate upload. The workflow cleanly handles completion, cancellation, and error scenarios with proper state cleanup.
