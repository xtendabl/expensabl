## Description

The sidepanel currently displays a collapsible 'Expense Templates' section that should be removed from the user interface. This is a UI-only change - the backend template functionality and message handlers should remain intact for potential future use or other consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Templates accordion section is completely removed from sidepanel HTML
- [ ] Template-related UI event listeners in sidepanel-ui.ts are removed
- [ ] Template-related UI state and methods in sidepanel-ui.ts are cleaned up
- [ ] No console errors occur when loading the sidepanel
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Other sidepanel sections (Expenses
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Help) continue to function normally

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine current sidepanel HTML structure to identify template accordion section\n2. Remove template accordion HTML from sidepanel.html\n3. Remove template-related event listeners from sidepanel-ui.ts\n4. Clean up template-related UI state and methods in sidepanel-ui.ts\n5. Test sidepanel functionality to ensure no regressions\n6. Run tests to verify no breaking changes

## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed the Expense Templates accordion section from the sidepanel UI. Removed the entire templates-section div (lines 2624-2955) and all associated CSS styles from sidepanel.html. The template-related backend functionality and message handlers remain intact as requested. All tests pass (49 test suites, 765 tests) confirming no breaking changes to other sidepanel sections (Expenses, Settings, Help). The sidepanel now displays only the core expense management functionality without the template UI.

Successfully removed the Expense Templates accordion section from the sidepanel UI while preserving backend functionality. 

**Changes made:**
1. **HTML Removal**: Completely removed the templates-section div (lines 2624-2955) and all associated CSS styles from sidepanel.html
2. **TypeScript Cleanup**: Stubbed template UI methods (fetchTemplates, renderTemplates, showTemplateList, showTemplateDetail) to prevent compilation errors while keeping backend template functionality intact
3. **Preserved Backend**: All template-related message handlers, services, and backend functionality remain untouched as requested

**Verification:**
- All tests pass (49 test suites, 765 tests) 
- Build compiles successfully
- No console errors when loading sidepanel
- Other sidepanel sections (Expenses, Settings, Help) continue to function normally
- Template backend functionality remains available for other consumers

The sidepanel now displays only the core expense management functionality without the template UI accordion section.
