## Description

When a user deletes a template, it remains visible in the side panel until the extension is closed and reopened. This creates confusion as users may think the deletion failed or attempt to interact with a deleted template. The UI should immediately reflect the deletion by removing the template from the list without requiring a manual refresh or extension restart. Relates to Jira EXPL-10.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deleted template immediately disappears from the template list
- [ ] Template count updates correctly after deletion
- [ ] No UI interaction with deleted template is possible
- [ ] State remains consistent after deletion without page refresh
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog still appears before deletion
- [ ] Success toast notification confirms deletion
- [ ] All existing template functionality continues to work

## Implementation Plan

1. Locate the template deletion handler in sidepanel-ui.ts\n2. Analyze why the UI is not refreshing after successful deletion\n3. Update local state to remove the deleted template\n4. Trigger UI re-render after state update\n5. Ensure template count updates in the UI\n6. Test deletion flow including confirmation dialog and toast notification

## Implementation Notes

Fixed template deletion not refreshing UI immediately. The issue was in fetchTemplates() which only called renderTemplates() when templates.length > 0, causing the UI not to update when deleting the last template. Fixed by always calling renderTemplates() regardless of template count. Also improved handleDeleteTemplate() to immediately update local state and re-render before fetching from storage, providing instant UI feedback. The template count, list view, and all UI elements now update immediately upon deletion.
