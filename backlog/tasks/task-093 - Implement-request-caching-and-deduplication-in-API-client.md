## Description

The API client currently makes redundant requests for the same data and doesn't cache responses. Implementing request caching and deduplication will reduce network traffic, improve response times, and decrease server load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Request cache is implemented with configurable TTL
- [ ] Concurrent identical requests are deduplicated
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategy is implemented
- [ ] API response times are improved by at least 20% for cached requests
- [ ] Memory usage for cache is bounded and monitored
