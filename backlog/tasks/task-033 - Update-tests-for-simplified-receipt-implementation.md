## Description

Update all test files to work with the simplified receipt implementation after removing unnecessary abstractions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All receipt-related tests pass
- [x] Test coverage maintained
- [x] Mock implementations updated
- [x] No broken tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Run all tests to check current status
2. Fix any broken tests
3. Update mock implementations if needed
4. Ensure test coverage is maintained
5. Run final test suite

## Implementation Notes

Tests already fully functional after simplification:
- All 700 tests pass successfully
- Build completes without errors
- Linting passes with only minor warnings
- No test updates were needed as the simplified implementation maintains the same interfaces
- Test coverage maintained through existing test suite
