## Description

The Expense ID field should not be configurable in the Customize Display settings as it's an internal identifier that users don't need to control. This option should be removed from the field customization list to simplify the user interface and prevent confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Expense ID option no longer appears in Customize Display modal
- [ ] Expense ID continues to display in expense list by default
- [ ] Existing saved field configurations remain functional
- [ ] No errors when opening Customize Display modal
- [ ] All other field options remain available and functional
