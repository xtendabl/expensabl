/**
 * Shared Utilities and Cross-Cutting Concerns
 * @packageDocumentation
 * @module shared
 *
 * This package contains utilities and services used across the application:
 *
 * ## Services
 *
 * ### logger/
 * Centralized logging infrastructure
 * - Chrome extension-aware logging
 * - Environment-based configuration
 * - Structured logging with levels
 * - Storage and console output options
 *
 * ### storage/
 * Abstract storage layer with transaction support
 * - Provider pattern for different storage backends
 * - Transaction isolation and rollback
 * - Atomic operations with batching
 * - Read cache for performance
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - **Provider Pattern**: Swappable implementations (Chrome storage, memory)
 * - **Transaction Support**: ACID-like guarantees for storage operations
 * - **Type Safety**: Generic interfaces with TypeScript support
 * - **Performance**: Caching and operation batching
 *
 * ## Usage
 * These utilities are injected as dependencies into feature modules,
 * promoting loose coupling and testability.
